#  Project Overview: Revitalizing AtliQ Grands with Data-Driven Strategies
The luxury hospitality market is relentless; it continually tries to outpace a business by offering superior service and using informed marketing strategies. After losing market share and revenue for more than a decade, AtliQ Grands seems to be in dire need. Competing strongholds, as well as improper management, have neglected the 20-year legacy of AtliQ Grands.
After assigning me with the project, I made it my mission to facilitate AtliQ Grands with efficient occupancy rates, reliable revenue systems, and above-average client satisfaction. My job as a data analyst was to ensure that raw data could be used for action planning.
# Tools & Techniques Used:
###  Power BI: The implementation of advance dashboards and DAX measures, along with calculated columns and dynamic visuals.
###  Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and noticing patterns for initial trends.
###  Power BI Integration:
Through Power BI, I facilitated decision makers with an immensely supportive, real-time analytics dashboard that empowered them to make decisions based on intuition. My contributions included:
 Revenue Trends & Forecasting – The identification of peak revenue weeks and seasonal patterns.
 Customer Satisfaction Analysis – The mapping of ratings with occupancy trends to further improve services.
 Dynamic Pricing Optimization – The application of RevPAR and ADR calculations enabled suggestions for maximum resource revenues.

# Key Business Insights & Impact:

 Even though Mumbai ranks first in revenue (₹669M), Delhi has the highest occupancy and ratings.


 The overall booking rates for Elite rooms are the highest; however, the cancellation rates are equally high which means a lack of a comprehensive pricing or refund strategy.

 AtliQ Seasons reports the lowest occupancy levels, less than 50%, while the average room rating is 2/5, which is reason for service concern.

Week 24 earned the highest in revenue (₹139.6M), validating our seasonal demand spikes postulation.

# My Contributions & Innovations:

 Developed a KPI dashboard that allows people to analyze revenue and occupancy metrics with ease.

 Added a stacked bar graph comparing weekend and weekday occupancy rates which will aid management with identifying the less productive days.

 Created DAX measures for RevPAR, ADR, and occupancy rate calculations which are vital for business insights.

 Added tooltips & slicers to enable users to perform city filter performance comparisons without any hassle.

# Key Takeaways & Business Value:

 Revenue optimization directly correlates with accurate data-based strategies.
 
 Customer review feedback provide great insight, as correlating ratings and revenue provide where services are lacking.

 Dashbaord design is equally important to the data presented, as it has the power to accelerate the business decision making process.
